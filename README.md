# NOSQL-Challenge
## Description
This program allows a user to create a user, add friendships between existing users, add thoughts, and comment on other user's thoughts. I learned how to use Mongoose and insomnia more extensively in this project.
## Installation
A user would need to clone the repo, install express and mongo, and run the code on their local server.
## Usage
Here is the demo video showing how the code works with all necessary routes run through Insomnia.
